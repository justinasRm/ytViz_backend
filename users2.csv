I have to wonder if this is just what a high level of skill feels like when you fast track things by pushing the learning process really hard and fast.  I've experienced this exact same thing, but playing FPS games (My code days are long behind me due to health so I play games a few hours a week for giggles).  When I first started, I sucked ass, but I made a conscious decision to get better.  I started using an aim trainer, I used music training approaches for doing the aim training, I optimized every physical part I could, etc.  Within a year, when I was in a match, I often found myself zooming with a sniper, whipping the crosshairs at someone's head, shooting, hitting them, unscoping, wheeling 180 degrees and be 10 feet away before my conscious brain even knew what happened.  Even slower paced stuff, it felt very much like watching someone else playing.  I would often watch my own gameplay afterwards and marvel at the headshots and tracking and I just couldn't believe it was my own gameplay.  I even started paying close attention while playing to see what I specifically felt and I would describe the experience as a sort of weird split personality thing where it's like one part of my brain was in tryhard mode, while the more conscious side was just kind of watching things unfold in this weird zen calm way.  Personally, I find the entire topic of skill and skill building fascinating.""}]",COBS: Sharpening Your FPS Skills,https://yt3.ggpht.com/DTAD1kOtKoG4Yt94tqApvWcngX_a6jN2T-6RFSmB1wXJWEvf2Ub3os50I6GRNp6O3QTqi27iMzQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,66449,445,124

UCGKGUzKhey0UbmHVoq8jIfg,"[{""video_id"": ""QHXET1G9Y5U"", ""like_count"": 0, ""comment"": ""An advice to all fellow coders having a burnout -- DON'T QUIT!\r\nI mean, don't just quit by sending a resignation letter. Here is the proper algorithm how to quit the right way (for FTE):\r\n1) Talk to HR and find out how many sick days you have (you may be eligible to up to 5 or even more). Tell your manager that you are feeling very sick and take all of them at once. You will get paid for that time while recovering.\r\n2) Schedule and take all the vacation days for that year. Depending on the company it could be up to 4 weeks, or more if you are in Europe. Just tell your manager that you need to take that vacation because your health comes first before anything else, yes, even before the deadlines. You will get paid for that time while recovering.\r\nAt this point, there are 2 options. \r\n3a) (Optional step) If you can find a doctor who will be willing to acknowledge that you have severe mental health issues, you can apply for Medical Leave benefits and go on the medical leave for as long the doctor is willing to approve it. You will get paid for that time while recovering.\r\n3b) After the vacation or medical leave is over, talk to HR and go to Unpaid Leave. This costs nothing to the firm and they will readily provide it to you. You can be on the Unpaid Leave for several months. ATTENTION: during this time, after a few weeks or months, the HR may contact you requesting to come back on a certain date. DO NOT REJECT this demand -- come back as requested. Don't worry - they have already put you on their black list and you won't stay there for too long anyway.\r\n4) Once the Unpaid Leave is over (or you came back on their demand), come back and join the team. Citing the health issues, ask your manager to excuse you from participation in all meetings, except the most essential ones. Do some PR's at your own pace, but don't strain yourself. You are already on your way out because of the Unpaid Leave you took, such things are usually not forgiven, so take it easy. It's only a matter of time that they will kick you out, most likely it's a matter of only a few weeks. You will get paid for that time, while not straining yourself too much.\r\nBecause you missed so much time, your performance evaluation during that period will be awful. That makes sense, because you didn't perform anything during that period. Therefore,\r\n5) Quietly wait for you manager to urgently contact you to give you the news. This can happen any day and it won't take too long. Just be patient. There is 95% chance that they will tell you that your position has been eliminated.\r\nIMPORTANT: that means that you lost your job not because of your misconduct, but due to unrelated circumstances, which will later make you eligible for Unemployment Benefits. You will get paid the unemployment benefits for the next few months while recovering from the burnout.\r\n6) Within the first week after the termination, apply for the Unemployment Insurance benefits;\n7) Downsize, move to a tiny apartment, and reduce all the expenses to a bare minimum. Get rid of all your addictions if you had any (drugs, booze, whores, smoking, etc.). They are expensive and will prevent your full recovery.\r\n8) During the recovery period, pray  every day to God to fully heal you, and after a few weeks or months, after you have sufficiently recovered, start doing something small, like a leetcode problem every day, or learning something new at your own pace (for example, for certifications), and think of ideas of your own projects that you can do with your skills. With these new skills, start implementing a new portfolio project that you might later showcase or maybe at some point even develop it into a platform for generating some income.\r\n\r\nHere are the advantages of the above approach:\r\n- You will get paid by the firm for several extra weeks of you burnout recovery (sick days + vacation + couple weeks of waiting for termination);\r\n- Because you lost your job not for any fault of your own and, most importantly, YOU DID NOT QUIT, you will be eligible for Unemployment Insurance benefits for up to a year (practically, at least a few months);\r\n- Because you didn't quit, you will be eligible for a decent SEVERANCE PACKAGE, which could be at least 10k+ or so.\r\n- If this was you first year of employment and you had a sign-up bonus, YOU WON'T NEED TO RETURN IT. If you just quit, you will have to return any sign-up bonus in full, which will probably be a nasty surprise for you if you didn't read the small print when accepting it.\r\n- All in all, with the above approach, you will collect ~50k+ extra income that will allow you to stay home for at least couple years to fully recover -- which may possibly save your life.""}]",Sapientum Octavus,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_mJWnsy-4D0HHK7e70lAjKZZtXkBBcCBOJGArgGB83flQAgJc3mP46709hKr12KPbfx0A=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0,0,0

I too had a rough first job, albeit for different reasons. Especially the part about being scared all the time and feeling like I know nothing. Your experience of getting another job and feeling normal again is awesome. I'm still in that year after the first job feeling terrible. But I'm inspired that it's possible to get back to work, and that the second job won't be horrible again!\n\nFor new grads: keep in mind a couple of things. (1) the workplace is very different from school: usually rigid hours, M-F, 8 hours per day, and you're *doing* as opposed to *learning*. (2) your job is more about what you can get done reasonably quickly, and not so much about learning things from books. It's a big change in mindset (3) CS programs are notoriously bad at teaching you about the frameworks used in production. CS programs have toy problems and one-off projects. Corporate coding is giant code bases (100k+ lines) and lean heavily on frameworks like Netty, Spring, Spark, Kafka, Angular, React, etc.\n\n*So don't panic when the going gets tough.* Try not to put a ton of pressure on yourself. It to take months to get familiar with the code. Companies know this, it's why getting a job as a new hire is so hard! They know you have a lot to learn. They know you won't be productive for several months as you get up to speed, or maybe even a year on a complex project. Learning how to navigate a big code base and learn frameworks is very challenging and your CS degree just doesn't prepare you for this. *Hang in there as best you can.* Underrated pro tip: *get plenty of sleep*. If you're chronically sleep-deprived then you learn slower and retain less information, which is a giant problem. \n\nFor more on what NeetCode may have experienced at Amazon, *look up imposter syndrome.*\n\nAlso keep in mind that *the adults around you are no longer looking out for you*. Through the end of your CS degree, adults are looking out for you and their job is to help you succeed. That ends immediately when you enter the workplace. So be prepared to *set boundaries*. Don't make a habit of working super long hours. Don't accept way-too-short project deadlines (infamous in SWE roles). Don't work weekends. Management and your team aren't necessarily helping you, they're helping themselves. It's better to be fired after a while and find a new job after a couple of months than it is to get so burned out you have to quit and take months or even a year+ to recover. (caveat: in a good workplace, your team and manager will indeed try to help you in your career. It's the bad places where management tries to grind you to dust to extract every last drop of performance from you as possible for minimum compensation).""}]",ShouterOfSanity,https://yt3.ggpht.com/sqjwCgFO0sxfis7rClmLcY12x5gG8OGTvZCL867nW8cU88_6L5zjCOcRj-HYL_TifBGKBZKT=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0,0,0

I really wish people would take the mystique off of the faang companies.  Working for Google or Amazon is not really all that different from working for any other company and too many engineers go into it thinking that it's going to be a special experience. This is one of the main reasons why so many of us suffer from imposter syndrome, it's so easy to go into a job and feel like you don't deserve to be there.  From my experience, the key to handling that sort of mentality is to just realize that everybody that you are working with probably also feels that way to some degree and even if they don't, they still have to work really hard to make everything look so effortless from the outside.\n\nThanks for telling your story.

Sooner or later it's going to destroy your mental health. My free advice to all of you is, when you start to realize it is going out of hands is start preparing for interviews, use the Company's brand and resources to prepare for interviews and get the offers. And try not to resign yourself, let them put you into PIP, you will get an option of Severance package which is roughly 3 months salary + Leave encashment. So, it would give you enough time to prepare more for interviews. I had been in Amazon from 3 years as SDE2 and every year I was a top tier performer. Last month my manager put me in PIP. And funny thing is, just 1 week before he put me in PIP, I delivered a very successful project and even managed to get Accolades from Away Team SDE3. So, when the PIP option was offered, I didn't take the single minute to decide to resign from Amazon and took the Severance package. There is no point of continuing at the Shit place where you are not respected. So just after 4 days of resigning, I started preparing for the interviews and gave my first interview just after 1 week. I was rejected obviously because I was still getting into the interviews mindset. Finally, after 3 weeks I got my first job offer from a Startup and I was relieved I can continue to provide for my family. Now, I have more interviews lined up in coming weeks. Let's see where my destiny takes me. But never let this Shit company play with you. Be Smart and play with it.

This is the expectation and will be used against you when you don't \""deliver on time.\""\n2. Daily standups where you have to talk to everybody, including your managers, about what you have accomplished on a daily basis and what you are expecting to accomplish today, and you will get comments about your approaches to further degrade your focus. They will ask you if there are \""blockers\"" which obviously you won't know ahead of time, so you will say \""no\"" and they will note that too. Micromanaging at extreme pressure.\n3. Velocity review at biweekly basis where they just look at the points you accomplished previous sprint and track your \""velocity.\"" Because you should NEVER STOP SPRINTING!\n4. \""Backlog grooming\"" reviews where everybody is gathered to go ticket by ticket (new or ones that are too old) to explain what the ticket is and how to fix it and estimate \""effort\"", which is usually in dev hours. Yes, they track your velocity by the hourly basis. And yes, you're expected to know how to fix something and also predict the future of how long it will take to do it, test it, and release it. And if you guess wrong, the team will review why the estimations are off because the data would show that you are only able to accomplish maybe 5 out of the \""estimated\"" 14 points. And, no, it's not that we are just guessing, it's your fault for not finishing.\n5. \""Proposal\"" reviews. They can be in the form of scope defining docs, \""working backwards\"" docs, 1-pagers, 6-pagers, design docs, correction of error reviews, \""sync\"" meetings between sister teams. All this (and likely more like POCs) just to argue about any business ideas. The business idea gets so warped by so many different voices all at the same time that it loses all business sense and value, particularly for the customers. Most ideas will be profit driven and likely squeeze the customers for every penny whenever possible. We will literally break laws to screw customers over if we think we can get away with it (Project Nessie, for a small example, I've worked on a few customer fucking features myself). Your ideas always suck, unless you're Level 6+. Then all of a sudden, you're a genius and everything you say must be done and everyone who disagrees must be eliminated.\n6. Oh that gets to the final fun part, PIPs and URAs. Because Amazon, like other dying rotting zombie \""FAANG\"" companies, hire using \""leetcode\"" questions, which are coding puzzles. Imagine that you're an accountant and when you interview for a job, the hiring employer asks you to solve Sudoku puzzles. Because Amazon hires some of the most degenerate \""programmers\"" and extremely unqualified \""engineers\"" all of the time, Amazon has a PIP process to \""give you a chance to not suck\"", but it's a process where an engineer is marked for improvement plan, in which the engineer is expected to accomplish a set of tasks that you are expected to fail. In which case, since you failed, it's your fault, Amazon will have to fire you. The PIP plan is bs. And yeah, I'm sure PIP will only be used to eliminate \""poor performing\"" engineers. Every manager is an angel and will never use PIP as a weapon or a form of intimidation. Also, here's the truth, you're never meant to pass it. This is coming from an L10+ individual. And then there's the URA, where the executives pressure each manager to mark people to fire (which leads to the PIP, see? synergy). There's a quota.\n\nOh, and this is just the \""meta\"" work. You still have to do the actual work of engineering, testing, measuring, releasing.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention this. As compensation, Amazon gives you a total compensation of $200,000~ for most L5 (mid level) engineers. Here's the twist, nearly half of it is in Restricted Stock Unit, which only pays out over the next several years. It gets worse. Because Amazon executives are insane and high on their own supply, they assume a 15% appreciation of the stock and will therefore deduct 15% of your RSU grant. And if at any point you get PIPed or just can't take it anymore and leave, your \""unvested\"" RSUs are forfeit. So yes, they will steal hundreds of thousands of dollars from you after they fire you.\n\n\""But this doesn't make sense. How can they take away your salary because they believe the stock will go up, but won't you lose even more of your salary if the stock dips?\"" Yes. And it gets worse. If the stock does really well, above the 15% you lose initially, Amazon will reduce the RSU grant so that, god forbid, your compensation doesn't accidentally go over the total compensation target.\n\nEnjoy Amazon.""}]",Chih Chang,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_lCmsa0rpUEuIb5zg9jw2Ez5fkV6XTJEDLtHz1Ienc=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0,2,0

About a year ago I decided to change my career into software engineering and about 2 months ago, I finally got a full time job in a startup. My senior there was a former Amazon engineer as well actually. Even though, throughout the interview process they kept telling me that \""everybody works long hours\"", \""fast paced\"" I thought I was up for the challenge. I was extremely stoked to get the job, and also if was in a field I was super interested in. And I was finally going to make some money so I could do the things I want to do. What I quickly realized though, there was a big lack of organization and everyone was so swamped that I got nearly 0 training. I was so stressed out trying to figure out stuff and learn and meet the deadlines that I even started smoking cigarettes, I would go to sleep at 12 am and wake up at 5 am from anxiety. It got so bad that I was literally having a mental breakdown and I could tell that I would get fired eventually. I ended up leaving at the end of a month. I felt same exact thoughts.. \""How did I end up here\"" etc... and you know what, I just got NeetCode Pro and started solving algorithm problems again. \nAs I said, it's crazy I come across this video right now.

When I got back to school, I went from raising my hand and calling out all the correct answers to not being able to solve 6*6 or something like 10-35\u2026 I literally felt like a mentally challenged person. My neck felt like someone hung weights around it with a chain. I would go to sleep crying. Fast forward now in college, my grades are pretty good before this semester but I also came in having to work at least 30 hours a week cuz my dad kicked me out (toxic family) and taking 16 credits\u2026 my dumbahh decided to get addicted to chess for a whole two months. One month before and one month during the semester I was going hard on chess, I would go to sleep playing chess. My rating did go up and all but two of my class got seriously fked. While two of them were As the other two were Fs. On top of that im working on my code so I can get a job and gtfo of this dumb minimum wage job that got me living paycheck to paycheck. I decided today after looking at my grades that I was going to quit all my classes and just focus on code. I dropped them all for Ws even though I had two As because I felt so ashamed and disgusted to have two Fs. I was crying on my way back home\u2026 thinking about how much of a loser I am, not having a car, renting a room and working a garbage job because I got kicked out and have to do it to survive and worst because I couldn\u2019t even maintain a B in the other two classes.  .thankfully I haven\u2019t wasted the day much and I had even time to learn some C++ which is not the language I was originally using but I wanted to expand so why not I Alr quit my classes. Today my whole neck hurts the same way it did last year but at least I\u2019m able to think logically and have computational power to do stuff.

Basically what you experience is depersonalization-derealization disorder. It comes and goes from time to time. It causes intense anxiety and can last up to 6 month on a row. I would highly suggest to see a psychologist get a prescription drug (short term benzos, long term SSRIs/SNRIs). You should totally have breaks, sleep well, do more activities and stop everything related to drugs (weed and alcohol can trigger this feeling). In a time it does go away, but be aware that it does come back and it can get worser over a period of time. Sticking to a healthy lifestyle , that means:\n- say goodbye to overworking (try to find a job where you feel in control of the situations)\n- say no to deadlines (if you feel you push yourself to a limit just say the truth that it's not doable in this time)\n- be honest (say how much your tasks are really taking, not that you can do it in 2 days and burn out)\n- imposter syndrome (google more about it)\n- want to help your family? (You can, but you totally shouldn't be the one who saves the world - Your parents can look at themselves)\n- take time off (switch off slack, telegram, team ...)\n- don't get dopamine hits (stop using your phone every minute)\n- eat health (no to MCD, sugar drinks)\n- Coffee (just a big no, try decaf)\n- Don't listen to the people saying weed eases anxiety (it's one of the main things that causes depersonalization-derealization)\n- I see you also try to diagnose yourself with psychosis (don't do this, unless you have a degree in psychology(i don't think you have it), maybe you're hypochondriac)\n- See a doctor to get a diagnosis!\n- Find also hobbies that don't involve programming (doing paintings, lego)\n- meditate\nI can continue the list if you like, but most likely this's just a starting point in a journey.""}]",Maurice Schilpp,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_m_D-V6PxNjJL3Vzs5oZ1cdHb6_2xxLibAE-kza0g=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0,0,0

(this duration could be configured). \n\nfor the old service, the caller was configured to have a poll for 45 days and 6 times a day!\n\n\ud83d\ude02. i learnt a lot during my time at this company. i had the coolest teams and the chillest manager. i even got to be the on call engineer (this was a lotttt harder than i expected).\n\nmy final project there was a reverse proxy, i developed. all the outgoing traffic from our monolith was routed via cloud functions (aws lambdas) and these were blocking flows. which means, our monolith had to maintain the open connection with lambda to get data from the outside servers which was then processed by the lambdas and returned to the monolith in a format that it understands. i converted this to a non blocking flow by introducing a reverse proxy .\n\nall in all, a very good experience for a junior""}]",Nithin Sai,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_lkhy3TtrIdDJRUcHd8LpHfw2Lzw6iqS5Ss6aXBH_DpzOP3=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0,9,0
